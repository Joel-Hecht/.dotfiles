### .dotfiles

This is my linux config


please run all bash scripts to set up.

makesymlinks.sh should be run without arguments, and will set up all symlinks needed for .dotfiles to run well

please only edit .dotfiles in this directory, as any changes to the .dotfiles in the actual filesystem will not be recorded to this repo
